# Introduction
With the trend of neural network, more and more people want to use deep learning with big data to predict the stock market. However, even if the accuracy of their model is good, those weights, ratios, and other combinations of numbers in neural networks are hard to be interpreted. So, it cannot help us understand the market. And models come from meaningless combinations can stand for long term and represent the market. Therefore, I want to use combination of different linear regression models on time series to simulate the neural networks. And take some useful skills in machine learning for time series to improve my model to predict the stock prices.
